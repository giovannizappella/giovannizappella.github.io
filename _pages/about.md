Short bio
---

I am a Principal Machine Learning Scientist at AWS, working on creating agents for code generation. Some of these agents currently power [Q Developer Agent](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/reinventing-the-amazon-q-developer-agent-for-software-development/). 
Proveiously I have been working on creating new solutions for [Aamzon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/de/sagemaker/), recommendation systems at Amazon Music and other internal systems for Amazon's retail business.


I also organize the [AutoML Seminars](https://automl-seminars.github.io/) in collaboration with [Aaron Kelin](https://aaronkl.github.io/), [Arber Zela](https://ml.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/profile/zela/) and [Jovita Lukasik](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/dws/people/researchers/phd-students/jovita-lukasik/) with the support of the ELLIS units Berlin and Freiburg.


Before joining Amazon I have been PhD Student in Applied Mathematics, at University of Milan (Italy) under the supervision of [Prof. Nicol&ograve; Cesa-Bianchi](http://homes.di.unimi.it/~cesabian/). During my PhD I also had the the opportunity to collaborate closely with [Prof. Claudio Gentile](https://sites.google.com/view/cgentile) and [Fabio Vitale](http://researchers.lille.inria.fr/vitale/).


Something that you cannot find on [my LinkedIn profile](http://it.linkedin.com/in/giovannizappella): some my jokes have been selected for [this book](http://www.amazon.it/Spinoza-Un-libro-serissimo-Andreoli/dp/8874245823/).
