Short bio
---

I am a Senior Machine Learning Scientist at Amazon Web Services based Berlin (Germany). 
I am currently working in the long-term science team creating new solutions for AWS SageMaker.

I previously worked on exporation/exploitation methods for recommendation systems. Those solutions
were deployed in several experiences within Amazon Music, most notably the ranking of content on the homepage
and the selection of playable entities based on customers' queries for the Alexa experience.

Before joining Amazon I have been PhD Student in Applied Mathematics, at University of Milan (Italy) under the supervision of [Prof. Nicol&ograve; Cesa-Bianchi](http://homes.di.unimi.it/~cesabian/). 
During my PhD I also had the the opportunity to collaborate closely with [Prof. Claudio Gentile](https://sites.google.com/view/cgentile) and [Fabio Vitale](http://researchers.lille.inria.fr/vitale/).

Something that you cannot find on [my LinkedIn profile](http://it.linkedin.com/in/giovannizappella): some my jokes have been selected for [this book](http://www.amazon.it/Spinoza-Un-libro-serissimo-Andreoli/dp/8874245823/).
